wordV.py should be given a path containing News Articles.
News Articles can have sub directories.
The program builds a word2vec model using gensim and stores the model which can then be loaded and used for different purposes.

python wordV.py /home/dir1/news_articlesDir

reu.py extracts news articles from reuters and stores them in a directory.
Need to manually change the directory and the dates or months


Use this for word2vec model
